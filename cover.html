         <br>
         <p><i>My name is Janis and i am coming form JÄ“kabpils that's my home town.
             while growing up my obsession was <b>Football</b> but besides that i was also dancing folk dance and modern dance till age 14.
             while in school years i had to play in orchestra becouse i was learning in music class.
             currently my hobbies are: reading books, exercising, listening to music, riding bike, walking,
              meditation (i'm beginner), podcast listening.

            <p><i>
            if we talk about technology then i'm intrested in <b>Artifical Inteligence</b> and <b>Crypto Currencies</b>, also i feel amazed
             by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsCul1sp4hQ">technology</a> like this. in my opinion
            they will be driving the world in near future. 
            I believe that there are good and bad ways of how to use technology, that's the reason i decided to start learning how to code
            (that's the good way :) ),
            i want to be one of those who are creating digital world and by doing so understand it better, not just consume it.
